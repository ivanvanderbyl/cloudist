Cloudist
========

Cloudist is a simple, highly scalable job queue for Ruby applications, it can run within Rails, DaemonKit or your own custom application. Cloudist uses AMQP (RabbitMQ mainly) for transport and provides a simple DSL for queuing jobs and receiving responses including logs, exceptions and job progress.

Cloudist can be used to distribute long running tasks such as encoding a video, generating PDFs, scraping site data
or even just sending emails. Unlike other job queues (DelayedJob etc) Cloudist does not load your entire Rails stack into memory for every worker, and it is not designed to, instead it expects all the data your worker requires to complete a job to be sent in the initial job request. This means your workers stay slim and can scale very quickly and even run on EC2 micros outside your applications environment without any further configuration.

Installation
------------

```bash
gem install cloudist
```

Or if your app has a Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cloudist', '~> 0.4.4'
```

Usage
-----

**Refer to examples.**

Configuration
-------------

The only configuration required to get going are the AMQP settings, these can be set in two ways:

1. Using the `AMQP_URL` environment variable with value of `amqp://username:password@localhost:5672/vhost`

2. Updating the settings hash manually:

```ruby
Cloudist.settings = {:user => 'guest', :pass => 'password', :vhost => '/', :host => 'localhost', :port => 5672}
```
 
Now and what's coming
---------------------

Cloudist was developed to provide the messaging layer used within TestPilot [Continuous Integration](http://testpilot.me) service.

TestPilot still uses [Cloudist](http://testpilot.me/ivan/cloudist) heavily and a number of features will be merged in soon.

Contributing to Cloudist
------------------------

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch e.g. git checkout -b feature-my-awesome-idea or bugfix-this-does-not-work
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
