# Cloudst Example: Sandwich Worker
# 
# This example demonstrates receiving a job and sending back events to the client to let it know we've started and finsihed
# making a sandwich. From here you could dispatch an eat.sandwich event.
# 
# Be sure to update the Cloudist connection settings if they differ from defaults:
# user: guest
# pass: guest
# port: 5672
# host: localhost
# vhost: /
